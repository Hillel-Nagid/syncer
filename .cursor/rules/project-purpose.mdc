The app is a syncronization engine between different services such as Calendars and music streaming services.
The app preserves the users' provacy, and doesn't store their syncronized datq persistently.
The app cross-syncs the users' data between different comparable services.
There is no meaning for syncing a service alone. It must always be paired with other services to sync with.
There are 2 syncs modes: sync-from, sync-to
A user can decide which direction to sync the data, enabling bidirectional syncing
A service can be synced with multiple other services in different directions.
A sync-job can be either running automatically in the backgroud, or manually initiated by the user.
